# PostgreSQL Migration Documentation

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the FastAPI application from MySQL to PostgreSQL and leverage PostgreSQL-specific features.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Database Configuration**
   - Added PostgreSQL connection parameters in `config.py`
   - Maintained MySQL configuration for migration purposes

2. **Database Connection**
   - Updated `database.py` to support PostgreSQL
   - Added Psycopg2 connection function for direct PostgreSQL access
   - Added database initialization with PostgreSQL extensions

3. **Data Models**
   - Enhanced models with PostgreSQL-specific features:
     - Added JSONB fields for flexible data storage
     - Added tsvector field for full-text search
     - Added UUID field for globally unique IDs
     - Added additional indexes for performance
     - Improved foreign key constraints with proper cascading

4. **Migration Script**
   - Created `pg_migrate.py` to transfer data from MySQL to PostgreSQL
   - Automated creation of PostgreSQL-specific features like triggers and indexes

5. **PostgreSQL Repository**
   - Added `pg_repo.py` with direct PostgreSQL access for advanced features:
     - Full-text search with ranking
     - JSONB querying and manipulation
     - Geospatial calculations
     - Advanced statistics with PostgreSQL window functions

6. **New API Endpoints**
   - Added endpoints to leverage PostgreSQL features:
     - Text search with relevance ranking
     - Feature-based filtering using JSONB
     - Nearby apartment search
     - Statistical analysis endpoints

7. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Added enhanced statistics page using PostgreSQL aggregations

## PostgreSQL Features Utilized

### Full-Text Search
PostgreSQL's full-text search provides powerful text searching capabilities:
- Used tsvector and tsquery for efficient text search
- Implemented relevance ranking with ts_rank_cd
- Set up automatic search vector updating with triggers

### JSONB Document Storage
JSONB allows flexible schema and efficient querying:
- Used for apartment features
- Used for user profile data
- Used for location coordinates
- Leveraged operators like `->`, `->>`, and `@>` for JSON querying

### Geospatial Features
Basic geospatial calculations without PostGIS:
- Implemented Haversine formula for distance calculation
- Used JSONB to store coordinates

### Advanced Statistics
PostgreSQL's aggregate and window functions:
- Used for user activity statistics
- Used for apartment analytics
- Implemented percentile and median calculations

### Performance Improvements
- Added GIN indexes for full-text search
- Added B-tree indexes for common query fields
- Optimized foreign key relationships

## Migration Process

1. Install PostgreSQL dependencies
2. Run Docker Compose to start both MySQL and PostgreSQL
3. Execute migration script to transfer data
4. Verify data integrity after migration
5. Switch application to use PostgreSQL

## Future Improvements

1. Add PostGIS for more advanced geospatial features
2. Implement partitioning for large tables
3. Set up replication for high availability
4. Add more comprehensive PostgreSQL monitoring
